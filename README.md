# Learning Spanish


This is an application where you can learn some simple words in Spanish.

  - You start with a spanish word, and try to enter it's english equivalent
  - If you get it right, great! Your stats will reflect your good work
  - If you get it wrong, no worries! You'll have plenty of opportunities to redeem yourself

# Creators

  - This application was built by full-stack developers Janet Leon and Aaron Whitehead

  - It was built in one week using a spaced repetition algorithm
  - Although we both worked on both the front and back end, Janet's primary focus was on the front-end and Aaron's on the back-end

  - You can find more of Janet's work and contact information here: https://iamjanetleon.com

### Future Plans

The game is currently in a quite simple state, as there aren't many words to learn. We look forward to continuing to work towards expanding the vocabulary,but also potentially including grammatical questions as well
